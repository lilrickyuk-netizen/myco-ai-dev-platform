## Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Priority 1: Complete Testing Infrastructure**
   - Focus on backend unit and integration tests
   - Implement coverage reporting
   - Set up basic CI pipeline

2. **Priority 2: Finish Frontend Integration**
   - Complete typed client integration
   - Fix remaining TypeScript issues
   - Add frontend tests

3. **Priority 3: Production Infrastructure**
   - Set up Kubernetes deployments
   - Implement monitoring and alerting
   - Create operational runbooks

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- Some TypeScript interface inconsistencies need resolution
- AI engine streaming could be enhanced with WebSocket support
- Database migrations could include rollback procedures
- Error tracking could be enhanced with external service integration

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexing is in place for common queries
- API responses include caching headers where appropriate
- File operations are optimized for hierarchical access
- AI provider selection includes response time tracking

## Security Measures Implemented

- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Authentication required for all sensitive operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Timeout protection against DoS attacks

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a production AI development platform with proper architecture, security, and scalability considerations.
