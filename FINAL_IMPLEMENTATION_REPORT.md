## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Unit Tests and Coverage Gates ✅

**Backend Coverage**: 
- Comprehensive test suite covering auth, projects, filesystem, AI, health endpoints
- Coverage threshold: ≥80% (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- Location: `backend/**/*.test.ts`

**Frontend Coverage**:
- React component testing with @testing-library
- Hook testing for API integration
- Coverage threshold: ≥80%
- Location: `frontend/**/*.test.tsx`

**AI Engine Coverage**:
- Python unit tests with pytest
- Service layer testing (LLM manager, agent manager, metrics)
- Coverage threshold: ≥80%
- Location: `ai-engine/tests/`

**Coverage Configuration**:
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      thresholds: {
        global: { statements: 85, branches: 85, functions: 85, lines: 85 },
        './backend/': { statements: 80, branches: 80, functions: 80, lines: 80 },
        './frontend/': { statements: 80, branches: 80, functions: 80, lines: 80 },
        './ai-engine/': { statements: 80, branches: 80, functions: 80, lines: 80 }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. API Contract Enforcement ✅

**Generated Typed Client**:
- OpenAPI specification: `backend/openapi.yaml`
- Auto-generated TypeScript types: `frontend/src/services/api/types.ts`
- Type-safe client: `frontend/src/services/api/client.ts`
- Generation script: `frontend/scripts/generate-api-client.ts`

**Features**:
- Full type safety between frontend and backend
- Automatic request/response validation
- Error handling with typed error responses
- Authentication token management
- Support for all API endpoints

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { apiClient } from '@/services/api/client';

// Type-safe API calls
const projects = await apiClient.listProjects();
const project = await apiClient.createProject({
  name: "My Project",
  template: "react-typescript"
});
```

### 3. Spectral OpenAPI Linting ✅

**Configuration**: `.spectral.yml`
- Extends OpenAPI 3.x rules
- Custom rules for MYCO API standards
- Validation for security, documentation, consistency

**CI Integration**:
```bash
npm run lint:openapi  # Integrated in main lint command
```

**Custom Rules**:
- Operation descriptions (10-500 chars)
- Schema property descriptions required
- Error response consistency
- Security requirements validation

### 4. Prometheus Metrics ✅

**Backend Metrics** (`backend/monitoring/metrics.ts`):
- HTTP request metrics (rate, duration, status codes)
- Database query performance
- Authentication metrics
- Project and filesystem operations
- AI request tracking
- Business metrics (users, projects, code generation)
- SLO metrics (availability, latency, error rate)

**AI Engine Metrics** (`ai-engine/services/metrics.py`):
- LLM request metrics (duration, tokens, cost)
- Agent session tracking
- Provider health monitoring
- Cache performance
- Error tracking and categorization

**Metrics Endpoints**:
- Backend: `/metrics` (Prometheus format)
- AI Engine: `/metrics` (Prometheus format)

### 5. Grafana Dashboards and Alerts ✅

**Production Overview Dashboard**:
- Real-time request rates and latency
- Service availability gauges
- Error rate monitoring
- LLM usage and token consumption
- Location: `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/production-overview.json`

**SLO Dashboard**:
- Availability SLO tracking (99.5%)
- Latency SLO monitoring (< 2s P95)
- Error rate SLO (< 0.5%)
- LLM latency SLO (< 30s P95)
- Service health indicators
- Location: `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/slo-dashboard.json`

**Alert Rules**:
- SLO breach alerts with criticality levels
- Infrastructure and performance alerts
- Security and business metric alerts
- Error budget and burn rate monitoring
- Location: `monitoring/prometheus/slo-alerts.yml`, `production-alerts.yml`

### 6. Enhanced Deployment Pipeline ✅

**CI/CD Stages** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

1. **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scan
2. **Unit Tests**: Coverage gate enforcement
3. **Code Quality**: Linting, type checking, OpenAPI validation
4. **Build & Push**: Docker images with caching
5. **Deploy Staging**: Kubernetes rollout with readiness checks
6. **Health Checks**: Service availability validation
7. **Smoke Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing
8. **SLO Validation**: Real-time metrics validation
9. **Production Deploy**: Manual approval + automated deployment
10. **Rollback**: Automatic on SLO breach

**SLO Validation Process**:
```bash
# Automated SLO checking
node tests/performance/slo-processor.js
# Validates: availability ≥99.5%, latency ≤2s, error rate ≤0.5%
```

### 7. Automatic Rollback Mechanism ✅

**Rollback Triggers**:
- Availability SLO breach (< 99.5%)
- Error rate SLO breach (> 0.5%)
- Critical service health failures
- Failed smoke tests

**Rollback Process**:
1. SLO breach detection
2. Automatic Kubernetes rollback to previous version
3. Rollout status monitoring
4. Team notification via Slack
5. Post-rollback validation

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# SLO thresholds in tests/performance/slo-validation.yml
rollback_triggers:
  critical:
    - backend.availability
    - backend.error_rate
    - ai_engine.availability
    - ai_engine.error_rate
```

### 8. Complete CI Pipeline Testing ✅

1. ✅ Unit tests with coverage thresholds
2. ✅ API contract enforcement
3. ✅ Code quality and linting
